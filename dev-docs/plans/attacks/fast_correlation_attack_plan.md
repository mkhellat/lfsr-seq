# Fast Correlation Attack Implementation Plan

**Status**: **COMPLETE** 
**Version**: 1.0 

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for Fast Correlation Attacks and Distinguishing Attacks, extending the existing Correlation Attack Framework. These are advanced cryptanalytic techniques that improve upon the basic Siegenthaler's attack by using more sophisticated statistical methods and iterative decoding techniques.

---

## Background and Motivation

### What is a Fast Correlation Attack?

A **fast correlation attack** is an improved version of the basic correlation attack that uses iterative decoding techniques (similar to error-correcting codes) to recover LFSR states more efficiently. The Meier-Staffelbach attack is the most well-known fast correlation attack.

**Key Advantages**:
- More efficient than exhaustive search
- Can handle weaker correlations
- Uses iterative decoding (belief propagation)
- Better complexity than basic correlation attack

### Meier-Staffelbach Fast Correlation Attack

The Meier-Staffelbach attack (1989) treats the correlation attack as a decoding problem:
- The keystream is viewed as a noisy version of the LFSR sequence
- The correlation coefficient determines the "noise level"
- Iterative decoding (similar to LDPC codes) is used to recover the state
- More efficient than exhaustive search for large state spaces

**Algorithm Overview**:
1. Generate candidate LFSR sequences for all possible initial states
2. Compute correlation with keystream
3. Use iterative decoding to refine candidates
4. Select best candidate based on correlation

### Distinguishing Attacks

A **distinguishing attack** determines whether a sequence was generated by a specific generator (e.g., a combination generator) or is truly random. This is a weaker form of attack that doesn't recover the state but can detect vulnerabilities.

**Applications**:
- Detect if a generator is being used
- Identify weak generators
- Security assessment
