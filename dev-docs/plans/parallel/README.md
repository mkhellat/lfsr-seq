# Parallel Processing Plans

## Overview

Plans and documentation for parallel processing implementation.

## Documents

### [parallel_state_enumeration_plan.md](./parallel_state_enumeration_plan.md)
**Plan for parallel state enumeration**

Original plan for implementing parallel state enumeration, including architecture, implementation steps, and challenges.

### [parallel_enumeration_complete.md](./parallel_enumeration_complete.md)
**Parallel enumeration implementation complete**

Documentation of completed parallel enumeration implementation, including what was implemented and results.

### [parallel_fork_migration_complete.md](./parallel_fork_migration_complete.md)
**Fork mode migration complete**

Documentation of migration from spawn mode to fork mode, providing 13-17x faster process creation and 2-4x overall speedup.

### [parallel_optimization_options.md](./parallel_optimization_options.md)
