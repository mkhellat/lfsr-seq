Stream Cipher Analysis
======================

This section provides a comprehensive introduction to stream cipher analysis,
focusing on real-world stream ciphers that use LFSRs. The documentation is
designed to be accessible to beginners while providing sufficient depth for
researchers and developers. We begin with intuitive explanations and gradually
build to rigorous mathematical formulations.

Introduction
------------

**What is a Stream Cipher?**

A **stream cipher** is a symmetric encryption algorithm that encrypts data one
bit (or byte) at a time, typically by XORing the plaintext with a pseudorandom
keystream. Stream ciphers are widely used in applications requiring high-speed
encryption, such as wireless communications, disk encryption, and network protocols.

**Historical Context and Motivation**

Stream ciphers have been used for secure communications since the early days of
cryptography. The Vernam cipher (1917), also known as the one-time pad, is the
theoretically perfect stream cipher, but requires a key as long as the message.
Modern stream ciphers use pseudorandom keystream generators to approximate the
security of one-time pads while using much shorter keys.

LFSR-based stream ciphers emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, with designs like
A5/1 (GSM) and E0 (Bluetooth) becoming widely deployed. However, many early
designs were found to have vulnerabilities, leading to the development of more
sophisticated designs like Trivium and Grain, which were selected as eSTREAM
finalists (2004-2008).

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Symmetric**: Same key is used for encryption and decryption
- **Streaming**: Processes data incrementally (one bit/byte at a time)
- **Keystream**: Pseudorandom sequence generated from secret key
- **XOR Operation**: Plaintext is XORed with keystream to produce ciphertext

**Why Analyze Stream Ciphers?**

1. **Real-World Relevance**: Many deployed systems use stream ciphers (GSM, Bluetooth)
2. **Educational Value**: Understanding practical applications of LFSRs
3. **Security Analysis**: Assessing cipher security and vulnerabilities

Key Concepts
------------

Stream Cipher Fundamentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Keystream Generation**:

The keystream is generated from:
- **Secret Key**: A secret value known only to sender and receiver
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: A non-secret value that varies per message
- **State**: Internal state of the cipher (LFSRs, memory, etc.)

The keystream generation process:
1. Initialize cipher state with key and IV
2. Run warm-up phase (optional, discards initial output)
3. Generate keystream bits by evolving state

**Encryption Process**:

.. math::

   C_i = P_i \\oplus K_i

where:
- :math:`C_i` is ciphertext bit :math:`i`
- :math:`P_i` is plaintext bit :math:`i`
- :math:`K_i` is keystream bit :math:`i`
- :math:`\oplus` is XOR operation

**Decryption Process**:

Decryption is identical to encryption (XOR is its own inverse):

.. math::

   P_i = C_i \\oplus K_i

**Key Terminology**:

- **Keystream**: Pseudorandom sequence of bits generated by the cipher
- **Key**: Secret value used to initialize the cipher (typically :math:`80`-:math:`256` bits)
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: Non-secret value ensuring different keystreams
  for same key (also called "nonce" or "frame number")
- **State**: Internal state of the cipher (LFSR states, memory elements, etc.)
- **Warm-up Phase**: Initial steps where output is discarded (removes
  initialization artifacts)
- **Encryption**: Process of converting plaintext to ciphertext using keystream
- **Decryption**: Process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext
- **XOR (Exclusive OR)**: Binary operation where :math:`0 \oplus 0 = 0`, :math:`0 \oplus 1 = 1`, :math:`1 \oplus 0 = 1`, :math:`1 \oplus 1 = 0`

LFSR-Based Stream Ciphers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many stream ciphers use LFSRs as building blocks because:
- LFSRs are fast in hardware
- LFSRs have good statistical properties
- LFSR theory is well-understood

**Common Design Patterns**:

1. **Multiple LFSRs**: Combine several LFSRs for increased complexity
2. **Irregular Clocking**: LFSRs don't always advance (clock control)
3. **Non-Linear Combining**: Use non-linear functions instead of simple XOR
4. **Filter Functions**: Apply non-linear functions to LFSR state
5. **Non-Linear Feedback**: Use non-linear feedback instead of linear

**Key Terminology**:

- **LFSR-Based Cipher**: Stream cipher using LFSRs as core components
- **Multiple LFSRs**: Using several LFSRs in parallel for increased security
- **Irregular Clocking**: LFSRs advance conditionally (not every step)
- **Clock Control**: Mechanism determining when LFSRs advance
- **Non-Linear Combining**: Using non-linear functions to combine LFSR outputs
- **Filter Function**: Non-linear function applied to LFSR state
- **Non-Linear Feedback**: Feedback function is not linear (generalizes LFSR)

A5/1 Cipher
-----------

**Overview**:

A5/1 is a stream cipher that was used for GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications) mobile phone encryption. It was designed in 1987 and became the
standard encryption algorithm for GSM voice and data communications.

**Historical Context**:

- **Designed**: 1987
- **Purpose**: GSM mobile phone encryption
- **Status**: Widely deployed, now considered insecure
- **Replacement**: A5/3 (KASUMI) and A5/4 (SNOW 3G) for 3G/4G

**Cipher Structure**:

A5/1 uses three LFSRs with irregular clocking:

- **LFSR1**: :math:`19` bits
  - Feedback polynomial: :math:`x^{19} + x^{18} + x^{17} + x^{14} + 1`
  - Taps at positions: :math:`18, 17, 16, 13`
- **LFSR2**: :math:`22` bits
  - Feedback polynomial: :math:`x^{22} + x^{21} + 1`
  - Taps at positions: :math:`21, 20`
- **LFSR3**: :math:`23` bits
  - Feedback polynomial: :math:`x^{23} + x^{22} + x^{21} + x^{8} + 1`
  - Taps at positions: :math:`22, 21, 20, 7`

**Clock Control**:

The clocking is controlled by a majority function:
- Clock control bits: :math:`\text{LFSR}_1[8]`, :math:`\text{LFSR}_2[10]`, :math:`\text{LFSR}_3[10]`
- Majority function: Outputs the majority value (:math:`0` or :math:`1`) of the three bits
- Clocking rule: An LFSR advances if its clock control bit matches the majority

**Output**:

The keystream is the XOR of the three LFSR output bits (most significant bit,
or MSB, of each LFSR).

**Key and IV**:

- **Key Size**: :math:`64` bits
- **IV Size**: :math:`22` bits (frame number in GSM)
- **Total State**: :math:`64` bits (:math:`19 + 22 + 23`)

**Initialization**:

1. Load :math:`64`-bit key into LFSRs (:math:`19 + 22 + 23` bits)
2. Load :math:`22`-bit frame number (IV) into LFSRs
3. Run :math:`100` warm-up steps (discard output)
4. Generate keystream

**Security Status**:

A5/1 has been extensively cryptanalyzed and is now considered insecure. Known
attacks include:

- **Time-Memory Trade-Off Attacks**: Barkan, Biham, Keller (2003) - can recover
  key in seconds with precomputed tables
- **Correlation Attacks**: Exploit correlations between keystream and LFSR sequences
- **Known-Plaintext Attacks**: Recover key from known plaintext-ciphertext pairs
- **Hardware-Based Attacks**: Side-channel and fault injection attacks

**Key Terminology**:

- **A5/1**: The stream cipher used in GSM encryption
- **GSM**: Global System for Mobile Communications, the standard for mobile phones
- **Irregular Clocking**: LFSRs don't always advance on each step
- **Majority Function**: Function that outputs the majority value of its inputs
- **Clock Control Bit**: Bit from each LFSR used to determine clocking
- **Frame Number**: The 22-bit IV used in GSM (represents frame number)
- **Warm-up Phase**: Initial 100 steps before keystream generation (discarded)

**Mathematical Foundation**:

The majority function for three bits :math:`a, b, c` is:

.. math::

   \text{majority}(a, b, c) = (a \land b) \lor (a \land c) \lor (b \land c)

where :math:`\land` is AND and :math:`\lor` is OR.

The keystream output at step :math:`i` is:

.. math::

   K_i = L_1[i] \oplus L_2[i] \oplus L_3[i]

where :math:`L_j[i]` is the output bit (most significant bit, or MSB) of
:math:`\text{LFSR}_j` at step :math:`i`.

The clock control mechanism ensures that at each step, exactly two of the three
LFSRs advance (since majority of three bits always has at least two matching
values). This irregular clocking introduces non-linearity and prevents simple
linear analysis.

**Algorithm**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Load key bits into LFSRs
   - Load frame number (IV) into LFSRs
   - Run 100 warm-up steps

2. **Keystream Generation** (for each output bit :math:`i`):
   - Get clock control bits: :math:`c_1 = \text{LFSR}_1[8]`, :math:`c_2 = \text{LFSR}_2[10]`, :math:`c_3 = \text{LFSR}_3[10]`
   - Compute majority: :math:`m = \text{majority}(c_1, c_2, c_3)`
   - Clock LFSRs: Advance :math:`\text{LFSR}_j` if :math:`c_j = m`
   - Output: :math:`K_i = L_1[i] \oplus L_2[i] \oplus L_3[i]` (XOR of three LFSR output bits)
